### Hi there 👋

I'm Akshat Sahu, IT undergrad at Manipal University Jaipur. I am a Photogapher, an aspiring Android App Developer and a Data Science enthusiast. I have experience working with a range of different programming languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work on something new.

I love photography because of the artistic freedom that I get from it. It drives me to look at things from different angles, which requires having different perspectives and being open minded. I can take a picture of anything and make it look even better with the way I manage the settings on my camera or with post-processing. This makes me feel very good about myself.
